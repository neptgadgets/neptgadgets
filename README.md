     - `/includes`, `/config`, `/assets`, `/install`
2. **Set permissions:**
   - Make sure the `/assets` directory is writable (for image uploads):
     - `chmod 777 assets`
   - Make sure `config/config.php` is writable (for installer to save DB settings):
     - `chmod 666 config/config.php`
3. **Create a MySQL database** (or let the installer do it for you).
4. **Run the installer:**

   - Follow the steps to check requirements, enter DB credentials, and create the admin account.
   - The installer will create all tables, default categories, and write your config.
5. **After install:**

   - Update business info in `config/config.php` if needed.
   - Remove or restrict access to `/install` for security.
